This repository contains the code for the paper: Refining Deep Neural Networks via Interpretability
Using Transfer Learning.

The Python code are all you need to do transfer learning on the cifar10 dataset applying the pretrained models: Alexnet and VGG19.
The 'Google-colab-code' folder contains the files needed generate the quantified visulization results on google colab.
